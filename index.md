I am currently working with the amaizing [research group](https://crypto.iti.kit.edu/english/research_group_rupp.php) at [KASTEL SRL](https://kastel-labs.de) headed by [Andy Rupp](https://crypto.kastel.kit.edu/english/head_of_group.php). Previously, I was a postdoc at [Social Informatics Laboratories](https://www.rd.ntt/e/organization/researcher/?lab=1015) of [NTT Japan](https://www.rd.ntt/e/index.html), working with [Ryo Nishimaki](https://www.nishimaki.info) on quantum cryptography. I obtained my PhD from the department of [Mathematics](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MA) of [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in) under the supervison of [Prof. Ratna Dutta](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ratna/). My doctoral thesis presents provably secure advanced cryptographic primitives such as witness encryption, fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption.

I was a research intern at the [Cryptography and Information Security (CIS) Laboratories](https://ntt-research.com/cis/) at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com). During this internship, I worked with [Pratish Datta](https://ntt-research.com/cis-people/) in the area of computing on encrypted data. I was also a visiting scientist at the [R. C. Bose Centre for Cryptology and Security](https://www.isical.ac.in/~rcbose/) of [Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in) hosted by [Prof. Mridul Nandi](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mridul/).
