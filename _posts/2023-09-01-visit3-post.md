I am visiting the [Cyber Security group](https://cybersecurity.unisg.ch) at the University of St. Gallen from 1st September to 31st October 2023. The visit is sponsored by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](https://www.snf.ch/en) through a joint project between me and [Prof. Katerina Mitrokotsa](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aikmitr/).

I attended the [Swiss Crypto Day 2023](https://swisscryptoday.github.io/2023/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) and gave a talk along with Katerina on one of our joint works (based on this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-023-09458-2)). The slides of our talk can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NJac4_DFZe00t4nTUfkZW6VCC-FdWMW8/view?usp=share_link).

During my visit, we went for a hike through the Swiss Alps of the Appenzell region. Hiking in the Swiss Alps of the Appenzell region is a truly memorable experience. The Swiss Alps are renowned for their breathtaking natural beauty, towering peaks, pristine lakes, and stunning vistas.
